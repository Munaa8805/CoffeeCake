      A cupcake (also known as a fairy cake) is a small cake designed to be
      eaten by one person, baked in a thin paper wrapper, and decorated with
      frosting on top.

      One of the mainstays at Coffee & Cake is our famous Red Velvet Cupcake. A
      well-guarded recipe combined with the natural ingredients make this little
      red rascal unapologetically delicious. Topped with decorative vanilla
      frosting, the Red Velvet Cupcake is a favorite among kids as well.
